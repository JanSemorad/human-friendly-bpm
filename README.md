Brainstorming on DSL (=domain specific language) nomenclature


<p>This site is primarily about <strong>finding the right </strong>nomenclature 
for describing processes. </p>
<p>Implementation is complete. But it is about bringing the formulation of 
processes even closer to ordinary people. They can really understand the real 
world better than we - the programmers. </p>
<p>Maybe you already know how to implement it in Javascript or Java or C. There 
are really a lot of low-level implementations. However, this DSL (= domain 
specific language) is above all. </p>
<p>This site is that the correct (all-comprehensible formulation) is half of the 
actual realization. If you do not believe it, do not waste your time with it ;-) 
. If, on the contrary, you have an appropriate or concise wording in this 
context, I will be happy to see the wording here. THX very much - because I am
<strong>not</strong> native english speaker. But this DSL has to be in english.<br />
