<h3 ><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragedy of IT&nbsp;:&nbsp; Lack of an idea or BL. </strong></h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(BL = business logic)

<p >The definition of BL in language of implementation - 
that is why IT <strong>suffers</strong> from a complete lack of BL. It is always visible when a 
new helper or utility or library appears. If such piece of sw is intended for 
direct use in a low level implementation language is accepted with (mostly) 
uncontrolled enthusiasm. This can take a few years. Then comes the sobering or 
anticlimax, followed by a moment of normality before anything else comes. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<br />
<p >If a helper, utility, or library is in a language other 
than the low level of implementation, it is mercilessly <strong>thrown away</strong> as 
(misunderstood) unnecessary. The 
fact that IT sticks to its low level language can be seen in the fact that even 
such helper, utilities and library are not enough and there is a need for 
different transpilers, reflections, annotations, language extensions, 
configurations, and various devops widgets.<o:p></o:p></p>
<br />
<p >In one word - Babylon, a reliable step for misunderstanding 
and hiding BL. Then there apperas one version after another, incompatible 
updates, many different variants even in one low level language, splitting 
effort, very little reuse, the reuse is at all one of embarrassing IT 
imperfections.<o:p></o:p></p>
<br />
<br />
<p >What's going on (=BL ;-) ) - it can not be seen, of course. 
I take this as evidence that IT despises BL. But on the other hand IT is hungry 
for BL. IT is finally willing to accept BL for their own IT needs. For the rest 
of the world, this is not the way. Machines should serve man, yet we are the 
slaves of machines at this point.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth is the consensus of reality 
	with the idea</strong></h2>. <p>IT only has the reality that is what it is. Idea can be just 
	BL, which can be robotic. For IT, everything is important, but there is 
	nothing to catch. The rest of the world progresses from substantial to 
	detail, so it works <i>(although the detail is important ;-))</i>. Unlike IT - in the rest of the world, it is a 
<strong>targeted</strong>, scientific 
	and convergent process from the outset.</p>
